# Challenge Summary
Turn given pseudocode into a merge sort function

## Whiteboard Process
![Whiteboard](merge_sort.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
This algorithm uses a combonation of recursive calls and looping, its time complexity is O(n * log(n)) and its space complexity is O(n) because of the callstack.
